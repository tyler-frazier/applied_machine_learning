# Wednesday

Using the [Classify structured data with feature columns](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/feature_columns) you prepared for today's class as a model example, train, validate and test a model that has wealth class as the target as follows.

- import the dataset city_persons.csv to your PyCharm environment 
- Initially set the target to the least wealthy class, 2 in this case, and set all other wealth class outcomes to 0 (3,4 & 5)
- Train, validate and test your model
- Interpret and analyze your results.  Did the model performance exhibit a particular trend?

### For tomorrow, read and produce the script on [Classify structured data using Keras Preprocessing Layers](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/preprocessing_layers) in preparation for class.
