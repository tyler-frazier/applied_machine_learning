# Tuesday

Using the [Custom training: walkthrough](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/customization/custom_training_walkthrough) script we developed during today's class, write a 1-1/2 to 2-page report that provides a description of the following.  

- the data used in the model
- how you created the `tf.dataset`
- how you specified your model architecture, including the input shape, the layers and other functions
- how you trained the model
- how you optimized the model
- how you estimated loss including a plot that describes that change per epoch
- how you evaluated the model with your test dataset
- how you made some predictions, including three new ones of your own and their results

### For tomorrow, read and produce the script on [Classify structured data with feature columns](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/feature_columns) in preparation for class.
