Using the [Text generation with an RNN](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/text_generation) script we developed during today's class, use the `shakespeare.txt` file to generate your own text that imitates the script from Shakespeare.  Produce your generated text and describe how it was produced, addressing the following aspects.

- Processing, vectorizing and predicting text
- Building and training the model
- Generating text

#### Stretch goal:  Add the [Advanced:Customized Training](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/text_generation#advanced_customized_training) procedure at the end of the exercise by specifying a starting point and implementing curriculum learning.
