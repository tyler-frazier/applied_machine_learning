Using the [Classify structured data using Keras Preprocessing Layers](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/preprocessing_layers) you prepared for today's class as a model example, train, validate and test a model that has wealth class as the target as follows.

- Import the dataset country_persons.csv to your PyCharm environment
- Initially set the target to the least wealthy class, 1 in this case, and set all other wealth class outcomes to 0 (2,3,4 & 5)
- Train, validate and test your model
- Interpret and analyze your results.  Did the model performance exhibit a particular trend?
